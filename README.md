# list-config-plugins

See if packages have expo config plugins available and if you are using them.

- Supports all types of expo configs

How it works:

1. If checks what packages you are using in your project (using information from expo)
2. Check if you are using expo config plugins


## Todo:
- \[ \] Monorepo support (might already work, not tested)
- \[ \] add support for more package managers (might also already work, not tested)
