# list-config-plugins [![npm][npm-image]][npm-url]

A CLI tool to find Expo config plugins available in your project dependencies.

## Overview

This package helps you manage your Expo config plugins by showing which dependencies have available plugins and whether they're currently being used in your project.\
Works on Expo & bare React-Native Apps (without Expo)

## Usage

Simply run the package using npx in your App directory:


```bash
npx list-config-plugins
```

### Example Output

```bash
  > npx list-config-plugins
Config Plugin Overview:

Used Plugins:
游릴  expo-notifications
游릴  expo-screen-orientation
游릴  expo-splash-screen
游릴  react-native-compressor

Bundled with Expo:
游닍  expo-camera
游닍  expo-dev-client
游닍  expo-file-system

Unused Plugins:
游린  @sentry/react-native
```

## Features

- 游댌 Scans your project for available Expo config plugins
- 游릴 Shows which plugins are currently in use
- 游닍 Shows which plugins are automatically added by expo
- 游린 Identifies unused available plugins
- 游깷 Finds config plugins provided by [expo @config-plugins/](https://github.com/expo/config-plugins)
- 丘뙖잺 Supports all types of React-Native & Expo configurations & Monorepos

## How It Works

1. Analyzes your project dependencies to identify packages with Expo config plugins.
2. Checks which config plugins are being used in your Expo configuration.

## Monorepo Support

Monorepos should work, this depends on where your config plugins are placed.
This package will search for config plugins in `./node_modules` and walk up the folder structure (`../node_modules`, `../../node_modules`, ...).
If your config plugins are there, it should work. (run with --debug to see where it is searching)
